## Duration

Preparing the test should take 3 to 5 hours.

## Task

Create a simple 3-tier application to manage contacts.

The application should allow the user to:

1. List the existing contacts
2. View the details of a contact
3. Create a new contact (fields: first name, last name, job, address, question)

Technology stack recommended:

1. React for the frontend
2. Python for the backend (e.g. fastapi, flask)
3. Database (any type that can store this type of data)
4. Docker files and docker compose

The project should contain:

1. `README.md` with the commands to install and run the app locally
2. A diagram of the architecture (component and interaction)
3. A minimal CI/CD to check the code quality before integration on main branch

## Comment

Anything that is not listed in the task section does not have to be developed.
No need to bother with access management, signing etc.

Testing should exist but remain minimal, just for demonstration purposes.
